## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned how to use flexboxed, media queries, html elements and many more.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
- Creat structure of the HTML5
- Give name of your project (title)
- Create the main structur of the HTML
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media only screen and (min-width: 560px) {
}
```
```css
- You can apply all the technologies you learn. (Flexbox, Grid)
- Set a background and define font color
- Set container background color and margin
- Define others color-size-padding etc...

```


### Continued development

I will build backend and extra pages for this website in the future.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schoold](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for basics of website paradigm. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing document which helped me finally understand deep sides of web development. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning these concepts.
